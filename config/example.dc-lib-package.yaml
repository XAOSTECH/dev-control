# Dev-Control Library-Only Packaging Configuration
# 
# This configuration is for building a lightweight standalone library package
# that includes only the shared Bash utilities (tui, print, colors, validation, etc.)
# without the full dev-control CLI, git integration, or plugins.
#
# Use Case: Projects that want to use dev-control's TUI/print/color libraries
# for consistent terminal output without pulling in the entire toolkit.
#
# Installation (library users):
#   curl -fsSL https://github.com/xaoscience/dev-control/releases/download/lib-v0.2.0/dev-control-lib-0.2.0.tar.gz | tar xz
#   # Then in your scripts:
#   source "/path/to/dev-control-lib/colors.sh"
#   source "/path/to/dev-control-lib/print.sh"
