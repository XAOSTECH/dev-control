# GPG Key Configuration for GitHub Actions Bot
# ============================================================================
#
# This configuration is used by scripts/lib/git/gpg.sh to generate a GPG key
# for automated signing of tags and commits in GitHub Actions workflows.
#
# Usage:
#   dc-gpg-setup
#   # OR
#   source scripts/lib/git/gpg.sh
#   setup_bot_gpg_for_repo
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
#   - Passphrase is auto-generated in memory during script execution
#   - NEVER stored in this config file or any other file
#   - Generated using: openssl rand -base64 32
#   - Passed directly to GitHub Secrets via gh CLI
#   - Both key and passphrase are stored securely in GitHub Secrets:
#     * GPG_PRIVATE_KEY
#     * GPG_PASSPHRASE
