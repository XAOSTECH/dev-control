# Custom commands directory
# Place additional .sh scripts here to extend gc functionality
#
# Each script becomes a command: commands/foo.sh -> gc foo
#
# Scripts should:
# - Source shared libraries from $DC_ROOT/scripts/lib/
# - Support --help flag
# - Respect $DC_QUIET, $DC_VERBOSE, $DC_JSON environment variables
