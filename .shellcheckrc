# ============================================================================
# Globally disabled checks (common patterns in this codebase)
# ============================================================================

# SC1091: Not following sourced files
# We use dynamic paths that shellcheck can't resolve at lint time
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Many variables are exported for use in sourced scripts or set for external use
# (e.g., GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_DATE for git filter-branch)
disable=SC2034

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# While good practice, this pattern is used extensively and changing it
# throughout would be disruptive. We handle errors via set -e where needed.
disable=SC2155

# SC2128: Expanding an array without an index only gives the first element
# In many cases this is intentional (getting first element for display)
disable=SC2128

# SC2088: Tilde does not expand in quotes
# These are often intentional for user-facing output/help text
disable=SC2088

# SC2188: Redirection without command
# Used intentionally for file truncation: > file (equivalent to : > file)
disable=SC2188

# SC2178: Variable was used as an array but is now assigned a string
# Sometimes we intentionally reassign variables with different types
disable=SC2178

# SC2221/SC2222: Pattern override warnings in case statements
# These are optimisation hints for duplicate patterns, not errors
disable=SC2221,SC2222
